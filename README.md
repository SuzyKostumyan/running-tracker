## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve user information.
- **Run Tracking**: Start and finish runs with details such as start and finish locations, times, and distances.
- **Statistics**: Calculate and retrieve user statistics, including the total number of runs, total distance covered, and average speed.
- **Run History**: Retrieve a list of all runs for a specific user with optional filtering by date range.

## Technology Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.2.2**
- **MongoDB**: Used as the primary database for storing user and run information.
- **ModelMapper**: For object mapping between DTOs and entities.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and testing, accessible at [http://localhost:4444/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:4444/swagger-ui/index.html) when the application is running.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and build automation.

## Database

- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Collections**:
  - **user**: Stores user details including first name, last name, birth date, and sex.
  - **run**: Stores details of each run including user ID, start and finish locations, start and finish times, distance, and average speed.
  
MongoDB is used for its scalability and flexibility in handling the JSON-like documents that represent users and runs.
